Hi, There! Apart from coding in python, I tinker with go and linux. I love anything to do with data, automation and cloud.

I first started my Linux journey in 2019 with manjaro. Then did a custom arch install and have been using fedora for the past 2 years on my personal day to day machine. Now I can succesfully exit vim correctly.

I like going to gym and a evening nature walk is all I need for a stressbuster. I occasionally game on my new xbox series s that i got in oct 2022.
